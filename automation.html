                        <h1>Work and Wealth</h1>
                        <p>Despite the emphasis on automation the movie talks very little about the implication that workers are theoretically being put out of work by the computerized systems for feeding the dinosaurs, guiding visitors, securing the park, etc. It seems that part of the idea is that being near dinosaurs is inherently quite dangerous, and therefore minimizing workers’ interactions with them is a very positive aspect, something the carnage in the movie does very little to challenge.</p>
                        <p>One comment made throughout the movie by Nedry is that he is under appreciated, especially in terms of monetary compensation, for the amount of work he is doing. He heavily implies that the reason he is willing sell the DNA to the rival corporation is that he isn’t being paid nearly enough. The obvious conclusion to this is that if he were paid more he wouldn’t have compromised the system and tried to sell the DNA. It’s interesting to note that the reason Nedry isn’t being paid “enough” could be one of several issues. Perhaps because programming was such a new and poorly understood field at that time, it was hard for Hammond to understand a fair price for Nedry’s work, which would only be compounded by the fact that he couldn’t exactly tell others what he was working on and get an outside opinion. However, the movie implies that Nedry had made several serious mistakes, which is why he was being underpaid. It’s very likely that the initial velociraptor killing shown at the beginning of the film was a result of Nedry’s locking system failing, and as a consequence of the very serious fallout from the incident his pay was being reduced in some manner.</p>

                        <h1>Networked Communications</h1>
                        <p>The movie doesn’t really discuss or feature any networked communications. The park is mostly limited to internal communication methods such as cctv cameras (even inside the tour vehicles) and a few phone lines inside the main office appear to be the methods of communicating with the outside world. This may actually be an intentional design point since from a secrecy standpoint restricting communication to the outside world is a very effective way of preventing leaks. If this park were to be built today it's virtually guaranteed that one of the workers would have tweeted out a pic of a 'sick t-rex selfie' and compromised the entire operation. It should also be mentioned that this movie was made slightly before the Internet had achieved widespread adoption, hence why it is never mentioned.</p>

                        <p>However, one may easily argue that being able to communicate with cell phones or use any sort of long-range communications system would have made things much easier. People wouldn’t have had to go out searching for others to make sure that they were safe or simply locate them if they could have just called each other. Perhaps more importantly accidents such as Tim getting electrocuted would never have happened since everyone would have known to stay away from the fences when they were being reactivated. There’s also the matter that, in a true emergency, more robust outside communication methods may have allowed the heroes to call and ask for assistance from off of the island to help them escape from the dinosaurs, though obviously this would have to be a last resort. However, with the computers down it’s likely many communication systems would not have worked anyway even if they were in place.</p>

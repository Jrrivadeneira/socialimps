                        <h1>Movie Maker's Intent</h1>
                        <p>The movie seems to distrust both the advances in genetic engineering and computer technology. This isn’t exactly an uncommon approach for science fiction movies where new advancement in science allows for x and y and no one considers the potentially disastrous results of misuse.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Misplaced Trust</h4>
                        <p>Nedry is the only person who did anything related to the computer systems at the park. Not only is he the only one in charge of the system, but the system has no failsafe and is used to run essential safety and security systems. This is the kind of computer system that you would have an entire department dedicated to. Especially if anyone’s lives could be at risk due to its failure. Failures on the scale of death also aren’t to be taken lightly. The fact that Nedry’s system failure leading directly to the death of a worker seems basically brushed off. In the real world they’d all be in handcuffs for negligence and workplace safety violations. One could say that there is an eerie similarity between this movie and the game Five Nights at Freddy’s in which you need to use electricity to keep a door shut. It’s almost like nightmare logic where after you wake up you realize the way you were dealing with the situation didn’t make any sense at all. 
                        </p>
                        <h4>Blind to dangers:</h4>
                        <p>Somehow it didn’t seem to strike them as incredibly risky to bring back the organisms that basically dominated the entire planet while our ancestors were nothing but little rats in the trees. In order to properly feed the dinosaurs one would guess that you had to bring back all kinds of insects and bacteria and plants. These are all biohazards and, somehow, no one bats an eye in the movie about genetic engineering. There isn’t the slightest consideration that everything they are dealing with is a potentially invasive species on an island that must be full of evolutionary biologists. They should consider themselves lucky that they didn’t release some devastating plague that would bring all of humanity to a hideous end.</p>
                        <h4>Lessons Learned</h4>
                        <p>The movie teaches three real lessons</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Pay careful attention to the potential dangers when you are dealing with something you have created</li>
                            <li>Have a second line of defence. Redundant safety is a common practice for a reason.</li>
                            <li>Understand the limitiations of a technology and where it should and should not be used.</li>
                        </ul>

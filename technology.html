                        <h1>Computing Technologies</h1>
<h4>Containment Device</h4>
<p>The first piece of technology that is shown in the movie comes in the opening scene. It is a containment device that they are keeping a velociraptor in, and it is about to be transferred to its exhibit. Even though the light turns green, what we understand to mean the containment unit is locked in, the raptor manages to dislodge the unit from the wall. It then grabs hold of one of the several armed guards and tries to drag him in while head security officer holds on to him. This is where the famous “shoot her!” line comes from, as he is telling the guards to shoot the raptor to try and save the guard from being eaten.</p>
<h4>Computer Imaging</h4>
<p>The next technology that we can see is a computer with an imaging device used to see fossils underground at a dig site. When Dr. Grant accidentally leans on the screen and it stops working, he gets aggravated stating “I hate computers” which is another interesting bit of foreshadow.</p>
<h4>Virtual Reality</h4>
<p>While they are on the ride we can see that there is a scientist working with what appears to be a Virtual Reality helmet and gloves. He is manipulating a three-dimensional model of DNA and the video talks about how they were able to insert the DNA of frogs into the missing holes in the recovered dinosaur DNA. The scientist appears to be literally grabbing sections of DNA and inserting them into the holes in the strand.</p>
<h4>Super Cost-Effective Egg Flipping</h4>
<p>After the party gets off the ride, they can see a series of tables where eggs are being incubated. The eggs are being monitored by scientists and there are robotic arms there to turn the eggs over and to hold them while they hatch. This was interesting, because they used the movie is set in 1993 and robotic technology was not nearly that advanced at that point. So, they must have gone through the pain to design a robotic arm just to monitor eggs and turn them over when a person could have easily done it and for a fraction of the cost. Hammond could put this much money into robotic arms but not better security systems to contain dinosaurs?</p>
<h4>Tour Trucks</h4>
<p>The next technology we see in the movie is the automated tour system. The two trucks take the group on a guided tour around the island to view the exhibits and provide information about them. It is interesting to note that when the tour guide programs are shut off, there is simply no way for the people inside the cars to manually operate them and the cars are stuck where they are unable to move.</p>
<h4>Electric Non-Reinforced Fences</h4>
<p>While on the tour, we see that the dinosaurs are being kept contained by high-voltage powered electric fences. They seem to be working as they are, but later on they will be turned off and the dinosaurs will totally just walk right through them like it’s no big deal. Also, they did manage to think of a manual override for the fences! Too bad it’s in some weird power building full of narrow hallways that can totally let you be ambushed by a velociraptor.</p>
<h4>Security System Meltdown</h4>
<p>Back inside the main building, we get to see the network of computers that controls all of the systems of the park. This system is written and maintained by Nedry, and right off the bat we see him complaining about not being appreciated and that he is not paid enough. Nedry has sole access to the security systems of the park, and we see him execute a program that disables all of the security doors and fences in all the exhibits so that he can steal dinosaur DNA as he plans on selling it for 1.5 million dollars. Nedry also states that the system is composed of more than 2 million lines of code, which is why Ray is unable to figure out how to turn the systems back on. Let it be known: having one person with sole access to your programs is a BAD idea! Should that person ever get hit by a bus (or, in this case, a Dilophosaurus) how screwed will your company be?</p>
<h4>Turning the Security back on</h4>
<p>Once the power systems have been manually turned back on and what’s left of the party is reassembled in the main building, they are once again trumped by technology. With a velociraptor aching to get into the room and eat them, they are unable to turn on the automatic door lock system and with no way to manually override it, and a 12 year old girl is able to go on the computer and figure out how to navigate her way into turning the security systems in the main building back on.</p>
<h4>Comparison with Similar Technologies</h4>
<p>When you look at the DNA manipulation technology in Jurassic Park, the way they present it is if it was an easily obtainable technology that is reasonably available and controllable to them. When we compare to Star Trek, a TV show which was aired in the 80’s, they showed DNA and cloning technology as a completely futuristic technology that did not seem like it would be available to us any time soon. [1] We can also compare the movie’s representation with the DNA technology in Avatar, which was released in 2009. In Avatar the scientists are able to take a human’s DNA and insert it into an alien Na’vi so that human is able to take possession of the alien body. Again, this DNA manipulation seems to be something completely futuristic and not something that would be feasibly available to someone today. [2]</p>
<h4>How Realistic is this Technology?</h4>
<p>As stated in the above section, Jurassic Park portrays the manipulation of DNA and cloning of animals (or dinosaurs, in this case) as a technology that was realistically available when the movie was released in 1993. This portrayal is completely unrealistic in the context in which they show it to us. They used a virtual reality headset to manipulate a 3-D model of a strand of dinosaur DNA to drag a piece of from DNA to fill in the holes in the model. This is clearly a bit far-fetched for the actual way that it was performed, but could the DNA of a dinosaur really be used to create a living breathing animal? There have been advancements in modern technology which allow us to “turn on” disabled genes in animals. [3] Theoretically, this technology can be refined and broadened to allow us to engineer new DNA, but first we need to learn more about how DNA works as a whole and how we can interact and modify it and adapt it to a host animal.</p>

                        <h1>Privacy</h1>
                        <h4>Government Privacy</h4>
                        <p>When exploring government privacy in the movie it’s important to realize that what Hammond was doing at Jurassic Park likely violated several laws. Unless the government contract he signed to get the land somehow allowed him to operate outside the law due to the land technically being private property, there must have been a ton of safety violations he was blatantly disregarding. Technically, because he was utilizing dinosaurs he may have planned to argue that, since laws likely don’t mention dinosaurs explicitly in their text, the laws didn’t apply as written, but based on all the carnage it’s clear that the laws as intended should have applied and thus been adhered to. At minimum he’s certainly violating workplace safety regulations and genetic experimentation restrictions.</p> 

                        <p>Therefore, it’s really no wonder that Hammond chose to keep what was really happening on his island a secret from the government. In this case we actually have an example of where the government finding out about this early on and shutting it down before things got out of hand actually would have prevented a ton of death and destruction. People may not enjoy government surveillance, but when extremely dangerous operations like this are being kept a secret it’s hard to blame the government for trying to find out about them and shut them down in order to protect their citizens’ best interests. Hammond should never have been allowed to risk other peoples’ lives for fame and fortune, and the government would have really been the only entity capable of shutting him down. They likely would have stifled otherwise remarkable scientific progress, but that’s still not an excuse for risking the lives of innocent people, especially your own grandchildren.</p>

                        <h4>Information Privacy</h4>
                        <p>Information privacy is not really addressed in the movie at all. One aspect of individual privacy that should be considered however is how Nedry apparently had so much privacy that he was able to orchestrate the deal with the rival company and insert malicious code to shut down the park without anyone else suspecting a thing until it was too late. Part of the issue is that Nedry is the only one who understands the system, so it’s arguable that even if measures such as code reviews were taken they may not have prevented him from carrying out his deeds. Still, it’s a great example of how limiting individual privacy can be seen as necessary in order to prevent disgruntled employees from causing massive damage or even loss of life.</p>

                        <p>It should be noted that, for security purposes, the cameras could definitely be seen as a necessary evil. While putting them in the car may seem a little excessive initially, when you consider the inherent risk involved with such a complex system and such dangerous attractions it becomes clear that ensuring that everyone is safe inside the car and nothing is being tampered with is the absolute highest priority. It may seem like having an attendant / tour guide inside each car would be a better solution, but that defeats the entire purpose of automation the park was built around. Perhaps strict usage policies should be enforced to minimize the invasion of privacy, such as not letting recordings leave the security office, only enabling microphone access during direct communication, and only storing the recordings for a set period of time. </p>

                <div class="row">
                    <div class="col-lg-6">

                        <h1>Conclusions</h1>
                        <h4>Never rely on just one person that understands everything (AKA bus factor)</h4>
                        <p>If there’s one thing to take away from Jurassic Park it’s that no one person should have unchecked power. Nowhere is this more obvious than in Nedry’s ability to have complete control over the entire Jurassic Park automation system with absolutely nobody else capable of overseeing his work on the island. Having someone else, whether a co-worker, supervisor, or even an independent consultant available to check over work is critical to writing successful, stable and safe code. Not only does having someone else who understands code on-site help to prevent malicious actions like Nedry’s attempt to shut down the park, but it’s also invaluable for catching innocent mistakes like unnoticed bugs or flawed practices before they’re discovered the hard way. Basically, having a second pair of eyes helps you write better code and makes it much more difficult for one guy to go rogue and wreck everything. And even if something does go catastrophically wrong and your lead programmer shuts everything down, locks you out, and then gets himself eaten by a venom-spitting Dilophosaurus, at least you won’t have to rely on a 12 year old girl using a flight simulator to somehow reboot your computer.</p>

                        <h4>Always have human-operable manual override</h4>
                        <p>There are multiple perilous situations in Jurassic Park that could have been entirely avoided if the park weren’t so laughably dependent on computer systems for even the simplest and most crucial tasks, such as driving around or even locking a door. While it makes for excellent dramatic tension for our heroes to be stranded and totally helpless right outside the T-Rex paddock without any way of driving off until the computer systems are restored there’s simply no logical reason for critical systems not featuring a manual override, especially in an emergency situation such as the disaster featured in the movie. It’s permissible for computer failure to lead to large inconveniences, but it should never leave people’s lives at risk. While having the ability to remotely operate door locks is awesome and a great example of how computers can make our lives easier and more efficient, we should never feel helpless without them, yet that’s exactly what happens in the movie. The only consequence of a computer system failing should be that now somebody has to get up and operate the doors themselves; they shouldn’t be physically incapable of something as simple as locking the door without the computer’s help. Jurassic Park serves as an excellent showcase for why, no matter how deeply integrated a computer system may be in the daily operation of something, there always needs to be a way to operate critical systems manually. </p>


                        <h4>Networked Communications GIVE OWN SECTION</h4>
                        <p>The movie doesn’t really discuss or feature any networked communications. The park is mostly limited to internal communication methods such as cctv cameras (even inside the tour vehicles) and a few phone lines inside the main office appear to be the methods of communicating with the outside world. This may actually be an intentional design point since from a secrecy standpoint restricting communication to the outside world is a very effective way of preventing leaks. If this park were to be built today it's virtually guaranteed that one of the workers would have tweeted out a pic of a 'sick t-rex selfie' and compromised the entire operation. It should also be mentioned that this movie was made slightly before the Internet had achieved widespread adoption, hence why it is never mentioned.</p>

                        <p>However, one may easily argue that being able to communicate with cell phones or use any sort of long-range communications system would have made things much easier. People wouldn’t have had to go out searching for others to make sure that they were safe or simply locate them if they could have just called each other. Perhaps more importantly accidents such as Tim getting electrocuted would never have happened since everyone would have known to stay away from the fences when they were being reactivated. There’s also the matter that, in a true emergency, more robust outside communication methods may have allowed the heroes to call and ask for assistance from off of the island to help them escape from the dinosaurs, though obviously this would have to be a last resort. However, with the computers down it’s likely many communication systems would not have worked anyway even if they were in place.</p>
